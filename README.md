# A Simple Terminal Emulator written in Go.

This is a work in progress. Very rudimentary. I'm primary using this repository to both learn Go and about psuedo terminals (TTY/PTY).

I started from this [article](https://ishuah.com/2021/03/10/build-a-terminal-emulator-in-100-lines-of-go/) and plan to add features such as the cursor, handling signals, escape codes, etc.

To run the terminal:

0. Install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install).

1. Clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/yeshwanth95/go_terminal.git
```
